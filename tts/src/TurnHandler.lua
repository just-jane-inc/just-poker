--[[
  Players and bots require oversight to complete their turns.
  For bots, all the information is already provided, so all that is needed is to
  animate their decision.

  (To Be Implemented) For players, actions taken by them must be inferred and described
  in a stateful format:
  - How many chips they have in their stack, their bet, whether they have enough to check,
    if they have added enough to call/raise, or if they are all-in. 
  - The state of their cards--are they in their hand, folded on the table, or showing for
    the showdown
  - Exchanges of chips--if the player has exchanged chips for a different denomination,
    this must be reported to the server.
